## Overview:
Blinkit is one of the India's largest and most convenient hyper-local delivery company,which enables you to order grocery, fruits & vegetables, and other daily essential in daily life.
In this, I have created a dashboard for the analysis of sales with respect to different location, items, rating, size, type and other features with the help of Power BI. And the dataset collected from youtuber's channel drive. And a huge thanks to them.

## Problem Statement:

## Outcomes:
1. The total sales is 1.08M.
2. The average rating is 3.9, which is quit good.
3. The total number of items sold id 7K.
4. The average sale is 141.2.
5. The sale is gradually growing from the year 2011.
6. The most sales taken by the Tier 2 location, which is 393.15k.
7. The medium size of outlet is much popular then that of other, which covers 37.83 % of total.
8. Items with low fat content are very popular then that of Regular, which is 64.6 % of total sales.


## Recommendation:
The overall sale is quiet good, but still there are some area of improvement for increasing sales, which are:
1. Tier 3 location has also posses competative sales as compare to Tier 2, so if we give focus on Tier 3 then it will also turns to a high sales giving location.
2. The sales trend over the year seems to be fluctuating, so we have to give more fucus on selling current trend products.
3. People prefer the product with less fat contents, we have to make sure and take care of people health as people prefer.
